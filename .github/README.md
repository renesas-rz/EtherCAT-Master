# General Information

This is an open-source EtherCAT master implementation for Linux 2.6 or newer.
This repository was forked from https://gitlab.com/etherlab.org/ethercat to provide specific support for Renesas RZ products, including custom patches and configurations.

See the [features file](FEATURES.md) for a list of features. For more
information, see https://etherlab.org/ethercat.

# Documentation

## Handbook

The PDF documentation is generated via LaTeX and can be build with the
following steps:

```bash
cd documentation
make
```

The PDF is automatically held up-to-date and can be [downloaded from
GitLab](https://gitlab.com/etherlab.org/ethercat/-/jobs/artifacts/stable-1.5/raw/pdf/ethercat_doc.pdf?job=pdf).

## Doxygen

To generate the Doxygen documentation, the following commands can be used.
Therefore, the configure script must have run (see the [install
file](INSTALL.md)).

```bash
git submodule update --init
make doc
```

An up-to-date Doxygen output can be found on
[docs.etherlab.org](https://docs.etherlab.org/ethercat/1.6/doxygen/index.html).

# Requirements

## Software requirements

Configured sources for the Linux 2.6 (or newer) kernel are required to build
the EtherCAT master.

## Hardware requirements

A table of supported hardware can be found at:
https://docs.etherlab.org/ethercat/1.6/doxygen/devicedrivers.html

# Building and installing

See the [install file](INSTALL.md).

# Dry-run and Field Simulation

A limited set of the userspace API is available in `libfakeethercat`,
a library which can be used to run an userspace application
without an EtherCAT master or with emulated EtherCAT slaves.
Please find some details [here](fake_lib/README.md).
